# Experimental LAN Networking (WIP)

This folder contains experimental and incomplete networking code explored during
development.

LAN-based multiplayer was investigated but not completed due to exhibition time
constraints and reliability concerns. The final playable demo uses local
split-screen multiplayer on a single machine.

The contents of this folder are provided for reference only and are not part of
the main game execution.
