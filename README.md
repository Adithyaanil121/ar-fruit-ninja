# ar-fruit-ninja
Interactive AR Fruit Ninja game using webcam hand tracking (Mediapipe) and OpenCV. Implements power fruits, scoring systems, and exhibition-ready visuals. Built and demonstrated at the PROTEK college exhibition.
## Experimental / WIP: LAN Multiplayer

We explored LAN-based multiplayer during development, but the feature was not
completed in time for the exhibition. To keep the demo stable, the final version
uses local split-screen multiplayer.

Experimental networking work (if any) is isolated in `networking_wip/` and is
not required to run the game.
